Welcome to my webpage! Here I share updates of my professional works like what projects I am working on, write down my own thoguths on something cool I recently came across, and so on.

## About Me

My research interests are primarily on understanding at fundamental level the mechanics and mechanical properties of material. Looking and trying to model materials at different length scales starting from macro to atomistic scale for understanding material behavior. Some of the frequently used methods include Continuum Mechanics, Finite Element, Molecular Dynamics, and Optmization Algorithms. Currently, I work on modelling multilayered 2D materials and how their properties can be altered using mechanical strain. Before joining University of Rochester in Fall 2017, I worked on flexible polymer nanocomposite materials and developed a pressure sensor using experimental and numerical methods during my Masterâ€™s degree at the University of Oklahoma.
